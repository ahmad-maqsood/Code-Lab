# Faulty-Calculator-Using-JS
A calculator which performs wrong calculations 10% of the time.

This faulty calculator does following:
1. It takes two numbers as input from the user
2. It perfoms wrong operations as follows:

+ ---> -
* ---> +
- ---> /
/ ---> **

It performs wrong operation 10% of the times

WORKING?
A random number is generated everytime the code runs, the number lies between 0-1. If the number is less than 0.1(10%), wrong operations are performed.


How to use?
Run the index.html file, three prompts will appear, fill them as instructed there. Then right click with your mouse, click on inspect and then on console, you will see your output there. 
If you don't want the random number to be shown there, just comment the line 8 in script.js.
